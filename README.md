# Data-Project-on-Murder-Data-Set
This was my school project for Data Science at UHD worked in R studio. 
The project analyses dataset taken from kaggle on Murder reports from 1908 to 2014. 
The project was worked with two other members whom are referenced within the project. 
My part was cleaning the data, showcasing the missing Na/NaN values, and the heatmaps that display the density of the n counts of murder cases.
