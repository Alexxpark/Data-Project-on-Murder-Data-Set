When reading about crime incidents or watching them, do you guys ever think about the statistics of how much more men are prone to kill than women, or why is that killers choose a particular weapon to kill or ever thought about the correlations where a perpetrator and a victim know each-other? In the data that we decided to work with is [US homicide reports 1980-2014].This dataset includes murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report from 1976 to the present and Freedom of Information Act data. Some of this data some cases were either solved or unsolved. It also includes homicides that were not reported to the Justice Department
This dataset was the most interesting and the most current data available in which contain victims' age, perpetrators age, location, state, year, weapon used, and data that align with our interest of what factors correlate with behaviors and motives of the killers. Our approach is to analyze the data and filter the dataset in order to answer the following questions; at what rate has the homicide data change since 1980?, what factors contribute to the year with the most kills? and what motives and behaviors contribute to a killer attacking their victim's. Through our analyzes we will find approaches to our findings. Our data will give a visualization and identify correlations within these murders throughout the year of 1980-2014.



# Our Questions #

What factors related to __motives__ and __behaviors__ of the killers?

# Looking at the Unfiltered Murder Dataset 
1. List count by murders 
2. Oldest / youngest murders 
3. top 10 highest states with the most kills 
4. How many weapons most used 
5. Show the amount of Victim.Age that shows 
6. what perpetrator sex had the most kills

- then transition into the filtered data

We also filtered the victim's age to be more accurate from combining them from age 1 to 100.
